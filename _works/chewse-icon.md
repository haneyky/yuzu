This rendering of a short introduction clip was created for an emerging makeup artist based in Portland, Oregon. Margie Zank has collaborated with well-known makeup lines such as Lime Crime, Anastasia Beverly Hills, Urban Decay, and more.

Her primary platform as an influencer is Instagram, but new goal is to branch out to other platforms. This introduction clip for her content was to start up a Youtube channel. She wanted something short and sweet, but matched her usual makeup aesthetic. She required no audio and wanted purely her name as she thought she was not big enough in the makeup community to brand herself with a logo.
