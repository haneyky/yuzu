## Introduction

This is where fine arts and design meets. Featured here are three works that display how illustration design can be applied in the real world.

## Illustrated Desserts

Postcards, stickers, and pinback buttons! These cute dessert illustrations were inspired by a study abroad opportunity in Seoul, South Korea back in Summer of 2019. There is much appreciation for the art of their food, and these are only an example of how tasty and delightful their foods can look.

We used transparency and light to make the interface look more open and indicate information. To make sure that text would still be readable even on a light background we used subtle drop shadows and a slight blur effect along with a generous text-shadow.

## Cards

While not in the initial brief. The design team felt that the current card design did not match the new UI assets and was not very legible when shrunk down to fit on the iPhone.

Some of the biggest changes were cleaning up the card shape and remove the textured background. To make the text more legible, we also bumped up the font size and removed unnecessary elements such as flavor text and artist description. Instead, those elements moved to the deck builder page. The team also moved the damage amount to the upper left to increase visibility.

## Symbols

The last component of the card we changed was the element symbols. The original symbols were more artistry rendered but did not scale well when smaller than 32px. Therefore a team member came up with a simpler flatter, more scalable symbol.
