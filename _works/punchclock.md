As a graphic designer at Oregon State University's Recreational Sports, there's only one thing that mattered: GO BEAVS! This includes following strict university brand guidelines, concentrating on optimum legibility, and utilizing the well-known orange, black and white color trio.

We work hand-in-hand with the marketing team creating print and digital assets for events, classes, and announcements for all Rec Sports facilities on campus.

## New spaces? New poster.

Clients from different departments at Rec Sports require plenty of information to be shared on their posters. It is our job as designers to organize them in the most efficient way possible.

This poster is one of many that shares immediate news from our team. This particular print was to announce new, renovated spaces in Dixon Recreation Center for cycling, olympic lifting, and combative strength training.

## Transition into virtual life.

Since the rise of COVID-19, a higher demand of social media deliverables needed to be created for Rec Sports. Below are examples of several Instagram story posts for students and members following our page.

## Internal needs.

There are many meetings to be held, and they drive the success for Rec Sports. This set of presentation slides were designed to share the financial history from the previous school year in 2020, and helps determine the next year's budget plan as well as potential sponsorships.
